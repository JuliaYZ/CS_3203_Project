# Project Title

Virtual Study Room (VSR)

## Project Vision

FOR all students WHO want to have a quality study environment, THE VSR is a Web-based service THAT provides general study tools, such as music, notes taking, calendar, reminder, and other support features that improve the quality of the study. UNLIKE other virtual study rooms that emphasize human-to-human interaction, OUR product will provide customers with a more private environment, which allows them to focus on their learning activities. Our product also provides a variety of study tools to assist them in enhancing their learning efficiency and managing their learning tasks in a more organized way.‚Äù

## Description

You may join any server for the virtual study rooms that you find online, but they require you to turn on the camera. There will be many people studying together on any server; the advantage is that everyone can motivate each other, but it will distract the study since everyone may discuss and chat throughout the study. And what we want to create is a study area that can belong to you. On our platform, you can play your favorite music, check your study list, schedule your study time and keep track of important information points. You don't need to visit dozens of websites to obtain these services, nor need to force human interaction; all of the learning tools you want can be acquired on our platform.
